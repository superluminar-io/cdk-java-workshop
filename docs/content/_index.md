# Delivering Modern Production-Ready Apps with AWS

In this workshop you will learn how to write a Serverless application using [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) 
and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). 
We will focus on code organization, deployment strategies, Infrastructure as Code (using AWS Cloudformation), and on operational tasks such as logging and monitoring.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- write GO code for the AWS Lambda platform and package dependencies
- use the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)
- enough bits of Cloudformation to get around on AWS
- AWS building blocks like DynamoDB and S3
- best practices for operations: logging, monitoring and tracing
- code organization: how to modularize a Serverless project
- URL routing and versioning with AWS API Gateway
- deploy a simple frontend
- sign-up and sign-in your users with [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
