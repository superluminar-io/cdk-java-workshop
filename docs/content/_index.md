# Delivering Modern Production-Ready Apps with AWS

In this workshop you will learn how to write a Serverless application using [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) 
and [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). 
We will focus on code organization, deployment strategies, Infrastructure as Code (using AWS CDK), and on operational tasks such as logging and monitoring.

Youâ€™ll learn how to:

- write code for the AWS Lambda platform and package dependencies using Java and Gradle
- use the AWS CDK
- enough bits of Cloudformation to get around on AWS
- AWS building blocks like DynamoDB and S3
- best practices for operations: logging, monitoring and tracing
- code organization: how to modularize a Serverless project
- URL routing with AWS API Gateway
